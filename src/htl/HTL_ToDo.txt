HTL To Do List

Document
	- Intro / general description of features (section per IPL, MIF, CXR, memories, ...)
	- Update config commands including macro descriptions

CXR
!	- move return parameters to entry

MIF
	- reads to shared variables
	- rewrite prefetch interface and code
	- Should writes to shared variables support subfield? Yes, but subfield must be entire width of variable to avoid sub variable writes.
	- Add run time check that Pause is after request for an instruction.

HIF
	- Add HIF Queue interface for host
	- Add HIF Queue macros for coproc inst usage

IPL
	- Where should specification of thread count be? Instance file? Config file?
!	- Add HtSleep(clocks)
	- Optimize generated code for assignment of dimensioned variables (PersMu10)
	- Add check that two stage variables do not have same name on consecutive clocks (causes name conflicts)
	- Add htCmd.m_htGrpId, HT_SEL_GRP_SM, runtime check of grpId and cxr group, use to terminate reset threads

Global variables

Shared variables

Private variables
	- add memories

Instance file
	- Should instance parameters be set like design parameters? (freq=150, instId=3, ramType=BRam)
	- Add syntax to allow set block/dist rams in design
	- Add non-symetrical module replication

Design file

Debug Trace
	- Automate chip scope

Performance Monitoring
	- Verify info

Error messages

General
	- check for valid names
