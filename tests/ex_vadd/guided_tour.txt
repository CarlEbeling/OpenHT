Guided tour of the Vector Add example design
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector Add design is a simple example that illustrates some of the 
capabilities of the HT toolset.  The design implements the following function 
using HT instructions running on the Convey coprocessor:

    uint64_t vadd(uint64_t *a1, uint64_t *a2, uint64_t *a3, uint64_t vecLen)
    {
	uint64_t sum = 0;
	for (i=0; i<vecLen; i++) {
	    a3[i] = a1[i] + a2[i];
	    sum += a3[i];
	}
	return sum;
    }

This guided tour provides an overview of this design and is divided into the 
following sections:

Section 1 - Source files
Section 2 - Build steps
Section 3 - Generated files
Section 4 - Reports

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 1 - Source files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are source files for the vadd project:

vadd
|-- Makefile
|-- src 		- Host source code
|   `-- Main.cpp
|-- src_model 		- Personality functional model source code
|   |-- Model.cpp
|   `-- model.htd
`-- src_pers 		- Personality source code
    |-- PersAdd_src.cpp
    |-- PersCtl_src.cpp
    `-- vadd.htd

The host source src/Main.cpp does the following:
  - allocates memory and fills operand arrays
  - constructions the HtHif (HT Host Interface) class and allocates units
  - copies arrays to coprocessor memory
  - sends message to coprocessor with pointer to arrays
  - sends calls to the units to compute vector add
  - waits for return from each unit
  - checks results

The coprocessor source is in src_pers and is made up of the following files:
  - vadd.htd - this is the HT description file in which the personality modules/
    functions are defined, including variables (private/shared/global), 
    interfaces needed (host message, call/return, memory, etc.)
  - PersCtl_src.cpp - this is the top-level entry point into the personality.  
    For each array element to be processed, it sends an asynchronous call 
    (spawns a thread) to the add function (implemented in PersAdd_src.cpp).  
    As each spawned thread returns, it accumulates the returned sum from the 
    thread.  Once all elements have been processed, it waits for all calls 
    to return (join), then returns the sum.
  - PersAdd_src.cpp - this function is called for each element of the array.
    It has the following steps/instructions:
    - load element from operand array 1
    - load element from operand array 2
    - wait for read data to return (thread goes to sleep)
    - add elements, store results to a3
    - wait for write to complete (thread goes to sleep)
    - return result

Section 2 - Build Steps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The build flow uses the Makefile at the top level of the project:
the HT makefile:

Makefile - type "make" to see a list of targets:
  model	Builds functional model application (app_model)
  sysc	Builds SystemC simulation application (app_sysc)
  vsim	Builds Verilog simulation application (app_vsim)
  app	Builds coprocessor application (app)
  pers	Implements coprocessor FPGA bitfile

Design and Build steps:

1.  Compile the application to use the functional model.  The functional model 
is a purely behavioral model of the personality implemented in C++.  It allows 
the programmer to develop the host application, including the runtime interfaces 
to the coprocessor, before developing the HT code for the coprocessor.  To build 
the app to use the model, run

	make model

This compiles the host source (in src/) and the model source (in src_model/) 
into an executable called "app_model."  

2.  Compile the application using the SystemC model.  

	make sysc

This compiles the host source (in src/) and the personality source (in src_pers/) 
into an executable called "app_sysc."  Running this application runs a 
cycle-accurate SystemC simulation of the design.  Most of the development and 
debug time is spent running SystemC simulation, which is significantly faster 
than Verilog simulation, as well as easier to debug.

3.  Compile the application for Verilog simulation:

	make vsim

This step generates Verilog files from the personality source (in src_pers/), 
then build an application called "app_vsim" to run a Verilog simulation of the 
generated code.  Running this application runs a Verilog simulation of the design 
using either Mentor ModelSim or Synopsys VCS (based on the CNY_PDK_HDLSIM 
environment variable (options are "Mentor" and "Synopsys").

4.  Compile the application for the Convey system:

	make app

This application should be run on the Convey system after the personality is 
generated.

5.  Build the personality:

	make pers

This step builds the personality (FPGA) from the generated Verilog files using 
the Xilinx development tools.  The FPGA build can take several hours and is 
typically done infrequently after the design has been fully debugged in SystemC 
simulation.

Section 3 - Generated files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following files are generated during the build of the HT project:

vadd
|-- HtDsnRpt.html 	- Design report generated during build
|-- app 		- application to run on the Convey system
|-- app_model 		- application that uses the functional model
|-- app_sysc 		- application for SystemC simulation
|-- app_vsim 		- script to run Verilog simulation
|-- app_vsim.exe 	- application for Verilog simulation
|-- ht			- generated HT project directory
|   |-- HtPrivRpt.txt
|   |-- phys		- physical (Xilinx) build directory
|   |-- sim		- Verilog simulation directory
|   |-- sysc		- Generated files for SystemC simulation
|   |-- verilog		- Generated Verilog files
|   `-- vsim		- Generated files for Verilog simulation
`-- personalities	- Generated personality directory (FPGA image)

Section 4 - Reports
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HtDsnRpt.html - The design report is generated when the design is compiled and 
contains information about the design including 
 - generated APIs
 - call graph (requires graphviz)
 - generated RAMs

To view the report, run

	firefox HtDsnRpt.html

HtMonRpt.txt - The performance monitor report is generated when the systemC
simulation is run (./app_sysc).  This report contains information including 
total cycle count, memory request counts and thread activity.
