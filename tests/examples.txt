The following are HT examples in this directory:

hello:  
Simple "Hello World" design.  A call to the coprocessor writes to a
buffer in memory.

vadd:  
Vector add design.  The host calls the coprocessor to add two arrays and
store the result in a third array.  Each call returns a sum reduction of
the result array, and the host does the final sum reduction across units.

vadd_prim:  
Vector add design.  This example illustrates how to utilize the HtPause()
and HtResume() functions to deal with latent operations, such as pipelined
math in a primative.

vadd_stream:  
Vector add design.  This example utilizes the streaming R/W interfaces
for memory accesses.

matrix_mult_bbox:
Staged matrix multiply design using a Coregen multiplier.  Similar
structure to vadd_5stage.

matrix_mult_bbox_r2:
Staged matrix multiply design using a Coregen multiplier.  Similar
structure to vadd_5stage_r2.
