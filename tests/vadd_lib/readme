vadd_lib example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The vadd_lib project is an example of how the library build flow can be used to 
build the application separately from the HT-specific portion of the code.  The 
HT code is compiled first, then linked into the main application.

Step 1:  Build the HT library:

  make libapp - build the library for the application
  make libsysc - build the library for the systemC simulation
  make libmodel - build the library for the functional model simulation

Step 2:  Build the application

    cd hostapp
    make

  This build 3 applications:

    vadd - application to run on the Convey system
    vadd_sysc - application to run systemC simulation
    vadd_model - application to run functional model simulation
